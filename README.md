# Tensor, logo existo(TLE)

## Getting Started
(TLE) is a blog, which seeks sharing high level A.I. information. The blog is full of experiments and guides on how to do things from scratch, or how to use high level tools.

## Language barrier
This repository and all of it's code is written and commented in english. In contrast any text or code posted on to the blog is fully written in portuguese. 

I chose to update this repository in english because at this point it's convention and any programmer should know english.

### Title meaning
"Tensor, logo existo" is a wordplay, the original sentence is "I think, therefore I am", where "I think" is changed to "Tensor", which means something like "I phink" in portuguese.

### The blog
Make sure to checkout the blog at "tensorle.com", or just click [here](https://www.tensorle.com "Tensor, logo existo")

## Installation
The main programming language used in this repository is Python. Regarding the requirements and dependencies: since each project may have a different requirement, I'll try and always keep a "requirements.txt" file updated on the top-level of the repository, with **all** requirements from all files.
